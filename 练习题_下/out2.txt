一、日常生活类
1.	My Daily Routine

2.	I wake up at 7:00 every morning. After brushing my teeth, I have breakfast with my family. Then I go to school by bus. In the afternoon, I do homework and play sports. I enjoy my routine because it keeps me organized and happy. 
3.	Family Life

4.	My family is very close. We often eat dinner together and share stories. My parents work hard, and I help with chores. Family time is the best part of my day. 
5.	A Visit to the Doctor

6.	Last week, I had a cold and visited the doctor. He checked my temperature and gave me medicine. Now I feel much better. Health is very important, so I take care of myself. 
7.	Weather and Seasons

8.	Today is sunny and warm. I love summer because I can swim and go to the beach. In winter, it’s cold but fun to play in the snow. Weather affects my daily activities a lot. 
9.	Shopping Experience

10.	I went shopping yesterday and bought a new shirt. The store had many options, and the salesperson was helpful. Shopping is a great way to relax and find new things.
